    "### Classifications\n",
    "Initially we need to get classifications of players, to train the model. To do this we shall use a current fantasy league system called `Fantasy Club Cricket`. Here club members have already carried out a manual classification of players in their club. This will allow us to get a much larger data set that origionally possible.\n",

    "To do this we shall analyse all clubs accessible on Play-Cricket that also have a fantasy league set up. For the purposes of this experiment, we shall limit the clubs to those who play in Warwickshire Cricket League. "
